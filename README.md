### Project Description
A waste counter boat using Arduino UNO is a quirky, useless project where a small boat collects floating waste, counts each item using sensors, and then releases it back into the water. It serves no real environmental purpose but demonstrates Arduino-based automation and sensor integration in a humorous way.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
 problem (that absolutely does not exist): Rivers are too tidy ‚Äî people keep throwing trash in perfectly straight lines. We need a boat that counts each offending piece so the river can file a complaint.



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
